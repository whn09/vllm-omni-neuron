## Introduction

[MiniMax-H3](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3) generates a video and its soundtrack
together. A 33B-parameter DiT runs 50 blocks of full self-attention over one packed sequence that
holds the prompt, the audio latents and the video latents; a Qwen3-VL-32B model conditions it, a
2.4B-parameter ViT decoder turns its video latents into frames and a BigVGAN decoder turns its
audio latents into a stereo waveform.

MiniMax-H3 text-to-video-and-audio (`t2va`), first/last-keyframe conditioning (`fl2va`) and
image/video/audio reference conditioning (`ref2va`) are supported for inference with
[vLLM Omni](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/vllm-omni/en/latest/) on AWS Trainium2 (`trn2`).

### Where each component runs

| Component | Placement |
|---|---|
| Qwen3-VL conditioner | At 64 cores (`model_config.text_encoder_device: auto`, the default): its 50 decoder layers on every NeuronCore, sharded 64 ways (~0.8 GB/core), and the vision tower's 27 blocks on every NeuronCore, the patch rows split 64 ways (0.9 GB/core of replicated weights); the token embedding, patch embedding, rotary/DeepStack inputs and patch mergers on the host (rank 0). Below 64 cores: all of it on the host (rank 0), the embeddings broadcast to every rank. |
| Video encoder (`fl2va` keyframes, `ref2va` images and videos) | NeuronCores; the tiles are split over all ranks. |
| Audio encoder (`ref2va` soundtracks) | Host, rank 0. |
| DiT | NeuronCores, TP x CP. |
| Video decoder | NeuronCores, replicated; the tiles of the clip are split over all ranks. |
| Audio decoder | Host (default, ~1 s), or NeuronCores with `model_config.audio_vae_device: neuron`. |

### Recommended configuration

MiniMax-H3 has 56 attention heads, so `tensor_parallel_size` must divide 56; use 8. Beyond 8
NeuronCores, `ring_degree` shards the packed sequence (context parallelism):
`tensor_parallel_size=8` x `ring_degree=8` uses all 64 cores of a `trn2.48xlarge`, as in
[`minimax_h3_stage.yaml`](https://github.com/aws-neuron/vllm-omni-neuron/blob/main/examples/minimax_h3/minimax_h3_stage.yaml).

Context-parallel attention all-gathers keys and values and runs flash attention locally; it does
not use the const-max ring-attention kernel, whose softmax bound is too loose for MiniMax-H3's
QK-norm scales (see `vllm_omni_neuron/diffusion/models/minimax_h3/attention.py`).

## Usage

```bash
python examples/minimax_h3/run.py \
  --model-path MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3 \
  --tensor-parallel-size 8 --ring-degree 8 \
  --output minimax_h3.mp4
```

`run.py` defaults to the released recipe (1344x768, 124 frames, 50 steps) and writes an `.mp4`
with the soundtrack muxed in. `--dev` runs a 704x384, 3-step, 2-layer smoke test.

`fl2va` passes the keyframes as `multi_modal_data={"image": ..., "last_image": ...}` (either may be
left out); the canvas follows the first keyframe's aspect ratio unless `height`/`width` are given:

```bash
python examples/minimax_h3/run.py --model-path MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3 --image first.png --last-image last.png
```

`ref2va` uses the checkpoint's second transformer partition (`transformer_ref/`), so it runs on a
stage of its own: set `model_config: {task: ref2va}` under the stage's `engine_args` (`run.py` does
this when given `--reference`). A request passes `multi_modal_data={"references": [...]}`, in the
order the model should read them; each entry is `{"type": "image", "image": PIL.Image}`,
`{"type": "video", "frames": (T, H, W, 3) uint8, "fps": ..., "audio": (C, N) | None,
"sample_rate": ...}` or `{"type": "audio", "audio": (C, N), "sample_rate": ...}`:

```bash
python examples/minimax_h3/run.py --model-path MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3 \
  --reference image:character.png --reference video:motion.mp4 --reference audio:voice.wav
```

### Prompt-length buckets

The DiT graph specializes on the packed sequence length, which includes the prompt. The prompt is
left-padded to the smallest length that makes the sequence a multiple of
`model_config.text_bucket_align` (default 512), and the padding is masked out of attention with the
kernel's KV bounds, so every prompt up to that length shares one graph and the sequence stays
512-aligned. `text_bucket_align: 1` compiles a graph per exact prompt length.

## Accuracy

DiT latents after two denoising steps, against the diffusers reference run on CPU in FP32. At
704x384 the diffusers reference itself run in BF16 sets the floor; at 1344x768 (a 178-token prompt)
the same diffusers model run on NeuronCores is shown for comparison.

| Canvas | Configuration | Video rel. L2 | Video cosine | Audio rel. L2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 704x384 | 8 cores (TP=8) | 7.8% | 0.9970 | 3.3% |
| 704x384 | 32 cores (TP=8 x CP=4) | 7.3% | 0.9974 | 2.8% |
| 704x384 | 64 cores (TP=8 x CP=8) | 6.4% | 0.9980 | 3.3% |
| 704x384 | Diffusers on CPU, BF16 (floor) | 9.1% | 0.9959 | 3.2% |
| 1344x768 | 64 cores (TP=8 x CP=8) | 5.5% | 0.9986 | 7.4% |
| 1344x768 | Diffusers on 64 NeuronCores, BF16 | 23.2% | 0.9730 | 11.0% |

`fl2va` (first and last keyframe) and `ref2va` (an image, a 1-second video with its soundtrack and a
2-second audio clip; an 8243-token presentation), 704x384, same protocol:

| Task | Configuration | Video rel. L2 | Audio rel. L2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fl2va` | 8 cores (TP=8) | 10.9% | 5.4% |
| `fl2va` | Diffusers on CPU, BF16 (floor) | 10.0% | 5.8% |
| `ref2va` | 16 cores (TP=8 x CP=2) | 13.8% | 8.1% |
| `ref2va` | Diffusers on CPU, BF16 (floor) | 12.4% | 10.1% |

Prompt buckets are exact: a 29-token prompt padded to its 58-row bucket and the same prompt
unpadded land at 9.55% and 9.56% from the FP32 reference.

Over a full 50-step generation, small numerical differences change the sample — the same scene
and motion, with drifting camera framing — so frame-level metrics against another implementation
are not a correctness test; the two-step comparison above is.

The decoders, given the same latents as the diffusers decoders (1344x768, 124 frames):

| Decoder | Against diffusers in FP32 |
|---|---|
| Video, FP16 on NeuronCores | PSNR 68.0 dB mean, 67.3 dB worst frame |
| Audio, FP32 on the host | SNR 123 dB |

## Performance

1344x768, 124 frames (5.2 s with audio), 50 steps, one `trn2.48xlarge`, a 29-token `t2va` prompt.
Each row is the second of two identical requests in one process (the first also pays one-time graph
loading), measured end to end at the Omni entrypoint.

| NeuronCores | Configuration | DiT s/step | Text encoder | DiT (49 steps) | Video decoder | Audio decoder | Request |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 64 | TP=8 x CP=8 | 1.429 | 0.16 s | 72.2 s | 13.9 s | 1.1 s | **89.2 s** |
| 32 | TP=8 x CP=4 | 2.547 | 5.0 s | 126.8 s | 15.8 s | 1.2 s | **151.1 s** |
| 16 | TP=8 x CP=2 | 5.013 | 2.8 s | 257.9 s | 16.1 s | 1.2 s | **280.4 s** |
| 8 | TP=8 | 12.694 | 4.4 s | 623.5 s | 19.2 s | 1.3 s | **650.5 s** |
| 4 | TP=4 | — | — | — | — | — | does not fit (see below) |

The 64-core row runs the conditioner's decoder layers on NeuronCores (the default there); with
them on the host the same request took 98.6 s, the host encoder taking 0.9–6 s for the same
prompt. Below 64 cores the conditioner is on the host.

`ref2va` at 1344x768 on 64 cores — an image, a 1-second video with its soundtrack and a 2-second
audio clip (an 8243-token presentation, 60928 DiT rows) — takes **222.7 s** per request: 47.9 s to
encode the references (most of it the video VAE encoder), 158.9 s of DiT (3.19 s/step, per-block
graphs) and 13.0 s of decoding. With the whole conditioner on the host it took 339.9 s. Peak HBM
for this request is 22.1 GiB per core of 24 (19.6 without the conditioner on NeuronCores).

The conditioner on NeuronCores matches it on the host to 1.5e-3 (relative L2) for a text prompt.
For the reference presentation above, against an FP32 run of the reference implementation:

| Rows | Conditioner on the host (BF16) | On NeuronCores |
|---|---|---|
| text | 1.3% | 1.6% |
| image | 45.7% | 18.2% |
| video | 17.6% | 19.4% |

The image rows are closer on NeuronCores because the vision tower's LayerNorms accumulate in FP32
there. (The FP32 run's video frames were decoded once more than these, so the video rows carry a
small input difference on both sides.)

A cold start compiles the DiT graph for the request's geometry: roughly 12 minutes at 64 cores and
longer at fewer cores, once per geometry, then cached.

### Per-block graphs for long sequences

Sequences of at least `model_config.compile_per_block_min_rows` rows (default 49152) run the DiT
as one graph per transformer block — structurally identical, so all 50 share one NEFF — plus a
prologue and an epilogue. The whole-model graph of a ~60K-row `ref2va` request did not finish
compiling in 4 hours; per-block it compiles in ~15 minutes. Each block launch costs ~8 ms, so
shorter sequences keep the whole-model graph (at 704x384 on 8 cores per-block is 2.49 vs 2.10
s/step).

## Known limitations

- **One device is not enough at 1344x768.** At `tensor_parallel_size=4` the DiT's compiled graph
  needs 29.7 GB of HBM per core against 24 GB.
- **Each bucket is its own graph.** Prompts are grouped into length buckets (see above), but a prompt
  past its bucket, a new canvas or frame count, and every `ref2va` reference set (whose geometry
  enters the sequence) compile a new DiT graph.
- **Without context parallelism, short prompts lost ~12%.** At 8 cores a 29-token prompt used to
  run unpadded (37739 rows, 11.340 s/step); its bucket is now the aligned 37888 rows (12.694), which
  is what an unpadded 178-token prompt always cost (12.624 on the previous code). With CP the
  aligned sequence is the faster one (16–64 cores gain 8–14%).
- **`ref2va` prompts are long.** Every image and video reference becomes a Qwen3-VL vision block in
  the prompt — an image at its 2048-pixel short edge and a 1-second video are thousands of tokens
  each — and its latents become as many DiT rows again. Below 64 cores the whole conditioner runs
  on the host (~95 s for that prompt), and the 704x384 test request does not fit 8 cores (23.9 of
  24 GB HBM).
- **The conditioner on NeuronCores needs the whole world.** Its 26B decoder parameters are ~6.5
  GB/core at TP=8, more than the ~4 GiB of HBM a 64-core `ref2va` request leaves free, so the layers
  are split over all ranks (at 64: ~0.8 GB/core). `auto` enables it only at 64 cores, where it was
  validated; 32 cores (~1.6 GB/core) can opt in with `text_encoder_device: neuron`.
- **Cold compilation is per rank.** Every rank compiles its own NEFFs; a cold 64-core start runs
  64 compiles at once and needs on the order of 1 TB of host memory.
- **Batch size is limited to one.**
