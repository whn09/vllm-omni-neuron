"""How the MiniMax-H3 DiT is laid out over the TP x CP mesh.

The DiT shards attention heads over the tensor-parallel group and the packed sequence over the
context-parallel group. Both groups are the plugin's (``get_tp_group`` /
``parallel_state.get_cp_group``), so on Trn2 they follow the physical-mesh layout the worker
builds; nothing here creates groups.

H3 has 56 attention heads, so ``tensor_parallel_size`` is one of 1, 2, 4, 7, 8. Past 8 cores the
other axis is context parallelism over the packed ``[text | conditions | audio | video]``
sequence. The CP group's collectives need equal shards and the released geometries are not
divisible (37739 rows at 1344x768 / 124 frames), so the sequence is padded at its end; H3's
attention takes no mask, so attention drops the pad rows from the gathered keys and values.
